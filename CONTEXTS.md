# CritterSupply Bounded Contexts

This document defines the bounded contexts (BCs) within CritterSupply, an e-commerce reference architecture demonstrating event-driven systems using the Critter Stack (Wolverine, Marten, Alba).

**Status:** Living document. When implementing integrations between BCs, consult this file first—it defines message contracts and integration patterns. Update when architecture changes.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- [Checkout Migration (Cycle 8)](#checkout-migration) — Checkout moved from Shopping to Orders

---

## Checkout Migration

**ADR Reference:** [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-checkout-migration-to-orders.md)

**Summary:** Checkout aggregate was migrated from Shopping BC to Orders BC in Cycle 8 to establish clearer boundaries:
- **Shopping BC** → pre-purchase exploration (cart management, future: wishlists, product browsing)
- **Orders BC** → transactional commitment (checkout + order lifecycle)
- **Integration:** Shopping publishes `CheckoutInitiated` → Orders handles and creates Checkout aggregate

**Completion:** Cycle 19.5 implemented the integration handler (`CheckoutInitiatedHandler`) and removed the obsolete `Shopping.Checkout` aggregate.

---

## Shopping

**Folder:** `Shopping Management/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 3-8, 16-18)
**Docs:** Cart patterns in `docs/skills/marten-event-sourcing.md`

**Purpose:** Manages customer's pre-purchase experience — cart lifecycle from initialization to checkout handoff.

### Aggregates

**Cart** (event-sourced)
- **Events:** `CartInitialized`, `ItemAdded`, `ItemRemoved`, `ItemQuantityChanged`, `CartCleared`, `CartAbandoned`, `CheckoutInitiated` (terminal)
- **Future Events (Phase 2+):** `CouponApplied`, `PriceRefreshed`, `PromotionApplied`, `CartAssignedToCustomer`
- **Lifecycle:** Cart ends with `CheckoutInitiated` (handoff to Orders) or `CartAbandoned` (anonymous timeout) or `CartCleared` (user action)

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| _(none — initiates flow)_ | `CheckoutInitiated` → Orders BC |

### Core Invariants
- Cart cannot contain items with zero/negative quantity
- Cart cannot transition to checkout if empty
- Unit prices captured at `ItemAdded` time (price-at-add-to-cart immutability, [ADR 0017](docs/decisions/0017-price-freeze-at-add-to-cart.md))
- Anonymous carts expire after TTL; authenticated carts persist indefinitely

### What it doesn't own
- Checkout process (Orders BC)
- Payment processing (Payments BC)
- Inventory operations (Inventory BC)
- Product catalog or pricing rules (Catalog/Pricing BCs)

### References
- **Skills:** `marten-event-sourcing.md` (aggregate patterns), `wolverine-message-handlers.md` (handler patterns)

### Aggregates

**Checkout** (event-sourced)
- **Events:** `CheckoutStarted`, `ShippingAddressSelected`, `ShippingMethodSelected`, `PaymentMethodProvided`, `CheckoutCompleted` (terminal)
- **Address Handling:** Stores `AddressId`, queries Customer Identity BC for `AddressSnapshot` at completion (temporal consistency, [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-ef-core-for-customer-identity.md))

**Order Saga** (Wolverine saga + Decider pattern)
- **States:** `Placed`, `PendingPayment`, `PaymentConfirmed`, `PaymentFailed`, `OnHold`, `Fulfilling`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`, `Cancelled`, `ReturnRequested`, `Closed`
- **Architecture:** `OrderDecider` (pure functions) + `Order` saga class (Wolverine conventions)
- **Entry Point:** `Order.Start(CheckoutCompleted)` — maps integration message to domain command

### Integration Contract

**Folder:** `Returns/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 25-27)
**Docs:** Returns event model in CONTEXTS.md (Appendix A), `docs/planning/cycles/cycle-27-returns-bc-phase-3-retrospective.md`

**Purpose:** Manages return and exchange workflows — eligibility, inspection, refunds, replacements.

### Aggregates

**Return** (event-sourced)
- **Types:** `ReturnType` enum — `Refund`, `Exchange`
- **Events:** `ReturnInitiated`, `ReturnApproved`, `ReturnDenied`, `InspectionStarted`, `InspectionPassed`, `InspectionFailed`, `RefundRequested`, `ReturnCompleted`, `ExchangeApproved`, `ExchangeDenied`, `ReplacementShipped`, `ReturnExpired`
- **Lifecycle:** Requested → Approved → Shipped → Inspecting → (Inspection outcome) → terminal state

- **Skills:** `wolverine-message-handlers.md`, `marten-event-sourcing.md`
- **Event Model:** See Appendix A below for detailed Return lifecycle

---

## Customer Identity

**Folder:** `Customer Identity/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 10-13, 17, 19)
**Docs:** [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-ef-core-for-customer-identity.md), [ADR 0012](docs/decisions/0012-simple-session-based-authentication.md)

**Purpose:** Manages customer accounts, authentication, profile data, addresses.

### Technology

- **Database:** EF Core + PostgreSQL (not Marten — relational fit, [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-ef-core-for-customer-identity.md))
- **Authentication:** Session-based (cookie auth, [ADR 0012](docs/decisions/0012-simple-session-based-authentication.md))

### Subdomains

- **Registration/Authentication** — Account creation, login, session management
- **Profile Management** — Customer info (name, email, phone)
- **Address Management** — Saved shipping addresses (CRUD, address snapshots for orders)

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| _(minimal integration — command-driven)_ | `CustomerRegistered` → Analytics |
| | `AddressSnapshot` queries (Orders BC) |

### Core Invariants
- Email address must be unique (cannot create duplicate accounts)
- Customer cannot authenticate without verified email (Phase 2+)
- Address snapshot is immutable — represents address as it existed at query time
- Session tokens must expire after inactivity period

### Address Snapshot Pattern

Orders BC queries `/api/identity/addresses/{addressId}/snapshot` at checkout completion. Returns immutable `AddressSnapshot` record embedded in `CheckoutCompleted` integration message. Ensures temporal consistency — orders preserve address as it existed at checkout time.

### What it doesn't own
- Order history (Orders BC)
- Payment methods (Payments BC — Phase 2+)
- Loyalty points (future Loyalty BC)
- Marketing preferences (future Marketing BC)

### References
- **Skills:** `efcore-wolverine-integration.md` (EF Core + Wolverine patterns)
- **ADRs:** [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-ef-core-for-customer-identity.md), [ADR 0012](docs/decisions/0012-simple-session-based-authentication.md)

---

## Customer Experience

**Folder:** `Customer Experience/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 16-20)
**Docs:** `docs/skills/bff-realtime-patterns.md`, [ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-signalr-migration-from-sse.md)

**Purpose:** Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) for customer-facing Blazor storefront — stateless composition + real-time updates.

### Architecture Pattern

**Stateless Composition BFF** — aggregates data from multiple BCs (Shopping, Orders, Catalog, Customer Identity) into view models for Blazor UI.

**Projects:**
- `Storefront/` (domain project) — Composition/, Clients/, Notifications/ (integration handlers)
- `Storefront.Api/` (Web SDK) — Queries/, Clients/ (implementations), StorefrontHub.cs (SignalR)
- `Storefront.Web/` (Blazor Server) — MudBlazor UI, SignalR client

**Real-Time Updates:** SignalR hub at `/hub/storefront` ([ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-signalr-migration-from-sse.md), migrated from SSE in Cycle 18)

### Integration Contract

| Receives (via RabbitMQ → SignalR) | Queries (HTTP) | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| `ItemAdded` (Shopping) | Shopping BC (cart) | _(none — pure BFF)_ |
| `CheckoutInitiated` (Shopping) | Orders BC (orders) | |
| `OrderPlaced` (Orders) | Catalog BC (products) | |
| `ShipmentDispatched` (Fulfillment) | Customer Identity BC (profile, addresses) | |
| `ShipmentDelivered` (Fulfillment) | | |
| `RefundCompleted` (Payments) | | |

### Core Patterns
- **Integration handlers** live in `Storefront/Notifications/` (domain project)
- **Handlers push to SignalR** via `IEventBroadcaster` → `StorefrontHub`
- **Blazor components subscribe** via `HubConnection` (MudBlazor `MudSnackbar` for toasts)
- **View composition** in `Storefront.Api/Queries/` endpoints

### What it doesn't own
- Domain aggregates (other BCs own truth)
- Business logic (delegates to domain BCs)
- Persistent state (ephemeral composition only)

### References
- **Skills:** `bff-realtime-patterns.md` (BFF patterns), `wolverine-signalr.md` (SignalR transport)
- **ADRs:** [ADR 0004](docs/decisions/0004-sse-over-signalr.md) (SSE rationale), [ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-signalr-migration-from-sse.md) (SignalR migration)
- **Cycles:** [cycle-16-customer-experience.md](docs/planning/cycles/cycle-16-customer-experience.md), [cycle-18-customer-experience-phase-2.md](docs/planning/cycles/cycle-18-customer-experience-phase-2.md)

---

## Product Catalog

**Folder:** `Product Catalog/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 21-22)
**Docs:** `docs/planning/catalog-listings-marketplaces-glossary.md`, Evolution plan in `catalog-listings-marketplaces-evolution-plan.md`

**Purpose:** Product master data — SKU, name, description, images, manufacturer info.

### Current Implementation

- **Document Store** (Marten, non-event-sourced) — CRUD operations on `Product` documents
- **Phase 0:** Product model with `sku`, `name`, `description`, `price` (embedded), `manufacturerName`

### Future Evolution (Cycles 29-35)

**Planned Migration:** Document store → Event-sourced aggregates ([ADR 0026](docs/decisions/0026-polecat-sql-server-migration.md), catalog-specific decision pending)

**Rationale:** Support recall cascades, compliance audits, price history, variant models (see `catalog-listings-marketplaces-evolution-plan.md`)

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| _(commands from Admin Portal)_ | `ProductAdded` → Pricing BC (Phase 1) |
| | `ProductDiscontinued` → Pricing BC |

### What it doesn't own
- Price rules (Pricing BC)
- Inventory levels (Inventory BC)
- Marketplace listings (future Listings BC)
- Product search indexing (future Search BC)

### References
- **Planning:** `docs/planning/catalog-listings-marketplaces-cycle-plan.md` (Cycles 29-35 roadmap), `catalog-listings-marketplaces-glossary.md` (domain language), `catalog-variant-model.md` (variant design)

**Docs:** [ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-blazor-wasm-for-vendor-portal-web.md), [ADR 0028](docs/decisions/0028-jwt-for-vendor-identity.md)

**Purpose:** Vendor authentication, multi-tenancy, invitation workflow.

### Technology

- **Database:** EF Core + PostgreSQL (same pattern as Customer Identity)
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer tokens ([ADR 0028](docs/decisions/0028-jwt-for-vendor-identity.md)) — required for Blazor WASM cross-origin calls

### Multi-Tenancy Model

- **Vendor** (tenant) — `VendorId` GUID, company name, status (Active/Suspended)
- **VendorUser** — Users belong to a single vendor, `VendorId` embedded in JWT claims
- **Invitation workflow** — SHA-256 hashed tokens ([ADR 0024](docs/decisions/0024-sha256-token-hashing-vendor-invitations.md))

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| _(commands from Vendor Portal)_ | `VendorRegistered` → Analytics |
| | `VendorUserInvited`, `VendorUserAccepted` |

### Core Invariants
- Vendor email must be unique per vendor (not globally unique — different vendors can invite same email)
- JWT tokens must include `VendorId` claim for tenant isolation
- Invitation tokens expire after 7 days
- Vendor must be Active for users to authenticate

### What it doesn't own
- Vendor product pricing (Pricing BC)
- Vendor order history (Vendor Portal aggregates from Orders BC)
- Vendor payout processing (future)

### References
- **Skills:** `efcore-wolverine-integration.md`
- **ADRs:** [ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-blazor-wasm-for-vendor-portal-web.md), [ADR 0024](docs/decisions/0024-sha256-token-hashing-vendor-invitations.md), [ADR 0028](docs/decisions/0028-jwt-for-vendor-identity.md)

## Vendor Portal

**Folder:** `Vendor Portal/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 22-23)
**Docs:** `docs/skills/blazor-wasm-jwt.md`, [ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-blazor-wasm-for-vendor-portal-web.md)

**Purpose:** BFF for vendor operations — order management, pricing updates, user administration.

### Architecture Pattern

**Stateless BFF + RBAC** — Blazor WASM frontend with JWT authentication, SignalR for real-time order updates.

**Projects:**
- `VendorPortal/` (domain project) — Composition/, Clients/, Notifications/ (integration handlers)
- `VendorPortal.Api/` (Web SDK) — Queries/, Commands/, VendorPortalHub.cs (SignalR)
- `VendorPortal.Web/` (Blazor WASM) — MudBlazor UI, JWT in-memory storage ([ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-blazor-wasm-for-vendor-portal-web.md))

**Roles:** `VendorAdmin`, `OrderManager`, `PricingManager`

### Integration Contract

| Receives (via RabbitMQ → SignalR) | Queries (HTTP) | Commands (HTTP) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| `OrderPlaced` (Orders, multi-vendor filter) | Orders BC (vendor orders) | Pricing BC (set MAP/floor) |
| `ShipmentDispatched` (Fulfillment) | Pricing BC (price history) | Vendor Identity BC (invite users) |
| `RefundCompleted` (Payments) | Vendor Identity BC (users) | |

### Real-Time Updates

- **SignalR groups:** `vendor:{vendorId}` — tenant-isolated push
- **JWT auth:** `AccessTokenProvider` delegate in Blazor WASM ([ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-blazor-wasm-for-vendor-portal-web.md))
- **Token refresh:** Background `System.Threading.Timer` (no `IHostedService` in WASM)

### What it doesn't own
- Vendor authentication (Vendor Identity BC)
- Order fulfillment (Fulfillment BC)
- Product catalog (Catalog BC)

### References

## Pricing

**Folder:** `Pricing/`
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (Cycles 22-23)
**Docs:** `docs/planning/pricing-event-modeling.md`, [ADR 0018](docs/decisions/0018-money-value-object-canonical-currency.md), [ADR 0020](docs/decisions/0020-map-vs-floor-price-distinction.md)

**Purpose:** Price rules, MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) / floor prices, temporal pricing, bulk price updates.

### Aggregates

**PriceRule** (event-sourced)
- **Events:** `PriceRuleCreated`, `PriceActivated`, `PriceExpired`, `MAPFloorSet`, `FloorPriceSet`
- **Lifecycle:** Draft → Active → Expired (or Scheduled → Active)
- **Audit Trail:** Every price change persisted as event (who, when, why)

**BulkPricingJob** (saga, [ADR 0019](docs/decisions/0019-bulk-pricing-job-audit-trail.md))
- **Purpose:** Apply price changes to many SKUs with approval workflow
- **Events:** `BulkJobCreated`, `BulkJobApproved`, `BulkJobApplied`, `BulkJobCompleted`

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `ProductAdded` (Catalog) | `PricePublished` → Catalog, Shopping |

**Docs:** `docs/planning/cycles/cycle-28-correspondence-bc-phase-1-retrospective.md`, [ADR 0030](docs/decisions/0030-notifications-to-correspondence-rename.md)

**Purpose:** Transactional customer communications — order confirmations, shipping updates, return status via email/SMS/push.

**Renamed (Cycle 28):** Originally "Notifications" BC; renamed to "Correspondence" to avoid ambiguity with real-time UI updates (handled by Customer Experience BC via SignalR). See [ADR 0030](docs/decisions/0030-notifications-to-correspondence-rename.md).

### Aggregates

**Message** (event-sourced)
- **Events:** `MessageQueued`, `MessageDelivered`, `DeliveryFailed`, `MessageSkipped`
- **Lifecycle:** Queued → (retry attempts) → Delivered or Failed (3 attempts max)
- **Retry:** Exponential backoff: 5min, 30min, 2hr

### Integration Contract

- Queued messages scheduled for immediate delivery (no explicit delay in Phase 1)

### What it doesn't own
- Real-time UI notifications (Customer Experience BC via SignalR)
- Customer preference management (queries Customer Identity BC — Phase 2+)
- Email/SMS provider infrastructure (delegates to `IEmailProvider`)

### Phase 1 Implementation
- **Provider:** StubEmailProvider (always succeeds, logs to console)
- **Channel:** Email only
- **Events:** OrderPlaced → "Order Confirmation" email
- **Idempotency:** Not yet implemented (documented for Phase 2)
- **Observability:** Basic Marten projections (MessageListView)

## Admin Identity

**Folder:** `Admin Identity/`
**Status:** ✅ **Implemented (Cycle 29 Phase 1)** — Authentication and user management
**Docs:** `docs/planning/cycles/cycle-29-admin-identity-phase-1-retrospective.md`, [ADR 0031](docs/decisions/0031-admin-portal-rbac-model.md)

**Purpose:** JWT-based authentication and authorization for internal admin users. Provides access tokens for Admin Portal-managed bounded contexts (Pricing, Promotions, Listings, Marketplaces, future admin tools).

### Entities

**AdminUser** (EF Core)
- **Properties:** Id, Email, PasswordHash, FirstName, LastName, Role, Status, CreatedAt, LastLoginAt, DeactivatedAt, DeactivationReason, RefreshToken, RefreshTokenExpiresAt
- **Roles (AdminRole enum):** CopyWriter, PricingManager, WarehouseClerk, CustomerService, OperationsManager, Executive, SystemAdmin
- **Status (AdminUserStatus enum):** Active, Deactivated

### Authorization Model

**Policy-Based Authorization** (per ADR 0031):
- **Leaf Policies:** One per role (e.g., `PricingManager` requires PricingManager OR SystemAdmin)
- **Composite Policies:** Role hierarchies (e.g., `PricingManagerOrAbove` = PricingManager, OperationsManager, SystemAdmin)
- **JWT Claims:** Single `"role"` claim (Phase 1 constraint: one role per user)
- **SystemAdmin:** Superuser included in all policy checks

**7 Roles (Phase 1):**
1. **CopyWriter** — Edit product descriptions, SEO metadata (Listings BC)
2. **PricingManager** — Manage prices, MAP enforcement, promotional pricing (Pricing BC, Promotions BC)
3. **WarehouseClerk** — Manage inventory levels, warehouse transfers (Inventory BC — future Admin Portal integration)
4. **CustomerService** — View orders, issue refunds, manage returns (Orders/Returns BCs — future Admin Portal integration)
5. **OperationsManager** — PricingManager + WarehouseClerk + CustomerService permissions
6. **Executive** — Read-only access to analytics/reports (Analytics BC — future)
7. **SystemAdmin** — All permissions (superuser)

### Integration Contract

**Phase 1 (Implemented):**

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| _(none — initiates auth flow)_ | JWT access tokens (15-min expiry) |
| | Refresh tokens (7-day expiry, HttpOnly cookie) |

**Phase 2+ (Planned):**

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `AdminUserDeactivated` (internal) | `AdminUserDeactivated` → Admin Portal (logout other sessions) |
| Commands from Admin Portal UI | Audit events (`AdminActionLogged`) → Analytics BC |

### Core Invariants

- Email addresses must be unique (unique index on `Email` column)
- Passwords hashed using ASP.NET Core Identity PasswordHasher (PBKDF2-SHA256)
- Refresh tokens unique (unique partial index on `RefreshToken` where not null)
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days; rotation required (token reuse prevention)
- Admin users cannot change their own role (requires another SystemAdmin)
- Deactivated users cannot log in (checked in Login handler)
- Single role per user (Phase 1); multi-role support deferred to Phase 2+

### What it doesn't own

- Admin Portal UI (separate BC — planned Cycle 30+)
- Audit logging (future: Analytics BC integration)
- Password reset workflows (Phase 2+)
- Multi-factor authentication (Phase 3+)
- SSO/OIDC integration (future consideration)
- Business logic for Pricing, Promotions, Listings BCs (only provides auth tokens)

### Phase 1 Implementation

**Authentication Features:**
- Login endpoint (`POST /auth/login`) — Returns JWT access token + refresh token
- Refresh endpoint (`POST /auth/refresh`) — Token rotation pattern
- Logout endpoint (`POST /auth/logout`) — Invalidates refresh token

**User Management Features:**
- Create admin user (`POST /admin-users`) — Requires SystemAdmin policy
- List admin users (`GET /admin-users`) — Requires SystemAdmin policy
- Change user role (`PUT /admin-users/{id}/role`) — Requires SystemAdmin policy
- Deactivate user (`DELETE /admin-users/{id}`) — Requires SystemAdmin policy (soft delete)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with `adminidentity` schema (EF Core)
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer)
- **Authorization:** Policy-based (7 leaf + 3 composite policies)
- **Password Hashing:** ASP.NET Core Identity PasswordHasher<AdminUser>
- **Validation:** FluentValidation for all commands

## Promotions

**Status:** 🔴 **High Priority** — Requires Pricing BC live first
**Purpose:** Coupon codes, percentage discounts, BOGO deals, free shipping thresholds.

**Why High Priority:** Shopping BC already defines future events (`CouponApplied`, `PromotionApplied`) — Promotions BC gives them authority. Direct revenue impact.

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `CouponApplied` (Shopping) | `PromotionActivated` → Shopping |
| `CheckoutInitiated` (Shopping) | `PromotionExpired` → Shopping |
| Commands (Admin Portal) | `CouponValidated/Rejected` → Shopping |
| | `DiscountCalculated` → Shopping |

### Core Invariants
- Coupon redeemed once per customer (unless multi-use)
- Discount cannot reduce price below MAP floor (queries Pricing BC)
- Stacking rules enforced (some promotions mutually exclusive)
- Usage limits enforced atomically (race condition risk at high traffic)

### What it doesn't own
- Base prices (Pricing BC)
- Campaign delivery (future Marketing BC)
- Payment processing (Payments BC)

---

## Search

**Status:** 🟡 **Medium Priority**
**Purpose:** Product search, filtering, faceted navigation, autocomplete.

**Technology Options:**
- **Postgres Full-Text Search** (lightweight, Phase 1)
- **Elasticsearch** (recommended for production scale)
- **Meilisearch** (simpler alternative to ES)

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `ProductAdded` (Catalog) | _(none — read-only BC)_ |
| `ProductUpdated` (Catalog) | |
| `PricePublished` (Pricing) | |

**Pattern:** Projection from Catalog + Pricing events → search index. Customer Experience BC queries Search BC for product listings.

---

## Recommendations

**Status:** 🟡 **Medium Priority** — Requires Analytics BC first
**Purpose:** Personalized product suggestions — "Customers who bought X also bought Y", recently viewed, trending.

**Algorithms:**
- **Phase 1:** Collaborative filtering (cart co-occurrence)
- **Phase 2:** ML.NET models trained on order history (Analytics BC data)

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `OrderPlaced` (Orders) | _(none — read-only BC)_ |
| `ItemAdded` (Shopping) | |

**Pattern:** Projection from orders/carts → recommendation model. Customer Experience BC queries for suggestions.

---

## Store Credit

**Status:** 🟡 **Medium Priority**
**Purpose:** Issue/redeem credits, gift cards, refund-to-credit option.

### Integration Contract

| Receives | Publishes |
|----------|-----------|
| `RefundRequested` (Orders) | `CreditIssued` → Customer Experience |
| Commands (Admin Portal) | `CreditRedeemed` → Orders, Payments |

**Pattern:** Event-sourced `CreditAccount` aggregate per customer. Redeemed credits reduce order total at checkout.

---

## Analytics

**Status:** 🟢 **Low Priority**
**Docs:** `docs/research/event-sourcing-analytics-ml-opportunities.md`

**Purpose:** Business intelligence — dashboards, reports, ML model training.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Phase 1:** Marten projections → Polyglot Notebooks (C# REPL for exploratory analysis)
- **Phase 2:** Debezium CDC → Kafka → data lake (Parquet)
- **Phase 3:** ML.NET models (churn prediction, inventory forecasting)

**Patterns:**
- **Redis caching** for ML inference features (1-3ms vs 15-55ms PostgreSQL)
- **Dual-publish:** RabbitMQ (operational) + Kafka (analytics)

### References
- **Research:** `docs/research/event-sourcing-analytics-ml-opportunities.md`

## Admin Portal

**Status:** 🟢 **Low Priority**
**Docs:** `docs/planning/admin-portal-event-modeling.md`, `admin-portal-ux-research.md`

**Purpose:** Internal tooling for operations, customer service, merchandising.

**Roles:** `Executive`, `OperationsManager`, `CustomerService`, `CopyWriter`, `PricingManager`, `WarehouseClerk`

**Architecture:** BFF pattern, Next.js SSR (recommended), SignalR for real-time alerts, RBAC via JWT.

### Integration Pattern

Admin Portal.Api composes views from multiple BCs (fan-out queries), routes commands to domain BCs, relays integration events to SignalR groups.

### References
- **Planning:** `docs/planning/admin-portal-event-modeling.md`, `admin-portal-ux-research.md`, `admin-portal-research-discovery.md`

---

## Operations Dashboard

**Status:** 🟢 **Low Priority**
**Purpose:** DevEx/SRE tooling — event stream visualization, saga explorer, DLQ management.

**Technology:** React (Next.js), SignalR, OpenTelemetry integration.

**Features:**
- Live event stream monitor (color-coded by result)
- Saga state machine visualization
- Dead Letter Queue dashboard (view, replay)
- Handler performance metrics (P50/P95/P99 latency)

**Audience:** On-call engineers, new engineers learning the system.

---

## Future Considerations (Long-Term)

These BCs are identified but not prioritized for near-term roadmap:

- **Reviews** — Product reviews, ratings (requires Catalog BC)
- **Procurement / Supply Chain** — Purchase orders, supplier management
- **Shipping / Logistics** — Carrier rate shopping, label generation (currently stubbed in Fulfillment BC)

---

## Appendix A: Returns BC Event Model (Detailed)

**Note:** This appendix provides detailed Returns BC lifecycle for implementation reference. See main Returns section above for integration contract.

### Return Aggregate Lifecycle

```
Return Stream States:
  Requested → Approved/Denied (terminal if denied)
           → Approved → Shipped → Inspecting → (Inspection outcome)
                                              → Passed → Completed (refund)
                                              → Failed → Rejected (terminal)
           → Expired (terminal, no action taken)
```

### Events (Full List)

**Refund Flow:**
1. `ReturnInitiated(OrderId, ReturnType.Refund, Reason, Items[])`
2. `ReturnApproved(ReturnId, ReturnLabel)` — publishes to Orders, Fulfillment
3. `InspectionStarted(InspectorId, ReceivedDate)` — triggered by `ReturnReceived` from Fulfillment
4. `InspectionPassed(InspectorId, Notes)` OR `InspectionFailed(FailureReason)`
5. `RefundRequested(RefundAmount)` — publishes to Payments
6. `ReturnCompleted(RefundId)` — terminal state, publishes to Orders

**Exchange Flow:**
1. `ReturnInitiated(OrderId, ReturnType.Exchange, ReplacementSku, Reason)`
2. `ReturnApproved(ReturnId, ReturnLabel)`
3. `InspectionStarted`, `InspectionPassed` (same as refund)
4. `ExchangeApproved(ReplacementSku, ShippingMethod)` — manual approval command
5. `ReplacementShipped(TrackingNumber)` — publishes to Orders
6. `ReturnCompleted(ExchangeId)` — terminal state

**Denial/Expiry:**
- `ReturnDenied(Reason)` — terminal, publishes to Orders
- `ReturnExpired()` — terminal, eligibility window closed

### Exchange Invariants (Phase 1)

- Replacement price must be ≤ original item price (no upcharge)
- Same SKU only (cross-SKU exchanges Phase 2+)
- Inspection failure → complete rejection (no partial exchange)
- Price difference → automatic refund to customer

### Integration Messages (8 total)

**Published by Returns BC:**
1. `ReturnApproved` → Orders (update saga), Fulfillment (expect return shipment)
2. `ReturnDenied` → Orders
3. `ReturnCompleted` → Orders, Payments (refund confirmation)
4. `RefundRequested` → Payments
5. `ReturnExpired` → Orders

**Received by Returns BC:**
1. `ShipmentDelivered` (Fulfillment) — start eligibility window
2. `ReturnReceived` (Fulfillment) — trigger inspection
3. `RefundCompleted` (Payments) — close return

### Command Handlers (Phase 3 — Exchange Workflow)

- `ApproveExchangeHandler` — manual approval after inspection
- `DenyExchangeHandler` — reject exchange (inspection failed or policy violation)
- `ShipReplacementItemHandler` — dispatch replacement (integrates with Fulfillment BC)

## Appendix B: Cross-Context Integration Patterns

### Orchestration vs. Choreography

**When to use Orchestration (Saga):**
- Multi-step workflows with complex compensation logic (Order saga)
- Central coordinator needed to enforce business rules
- Strong consistency requirements (payment + inventory + fulfillment)

**When to use Choreography (Event-driven):**
- Loosely coupled workflows (Correspondence BC reacting to events)
- No central coordinator needed
- Eventual consistency acceptable

### Message Naming Conventions

- **Commands:** Imperative (e.g., `PlaceOrder`, `CapturePayment`)
- **Events:** Past tense (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentCaptured`)
- **Integration Messages:** Published to RabbitMQ, handled by multiple BCs

### Idempotency Patterns

- **Wolverine MessageId:** Handler stores `MessageId` to prevent duplicate processing
- **Natural Keys:** Use deterministic IDs (UUID v5 for cart/checkout, [ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-uuid-v5-for-natural-key-stream-ids.md))
- **Projections:** Use `$version` for optimistic concurrency
