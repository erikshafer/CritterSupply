# Customer Experience BC - Workflow Documentation

**Bounded Context:** Customer Experience (Storefront BFF)  
**Pattern:** Backend-for-Frontend + Server-Sent Events (SSE) Real-Time Updates  
**Database:** None (stateless aggregation layer)  
**RabbitMQ:** ✅ Configured (subscribes to notifications from Shopping, Orders, Payments, Fulfillment)

---

## Overview

Customer Experience BC is a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** that aggregates data from multiple bounded contexts and provides real-time updates to the Blazor Web frontend via Server-Sent Events (SSE). It does not own any domain state—it's a pure composition layer that orchestrates queries and broadcasts notifications.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Compose views from multiple BCs (CartView, CheckoutView, OrderStatusView)
- Subscribe to integration events via RabbitMQ
- Broadcast real-time updates to connected browser clients via SSE

**Integration Pattern:** Choreography (subscribes to events, does not publish commands)

---

## 1. BFF Architecture Pattern

### Conceptual Model

```mermaid
graph TD
    Browser[Blazor Web Browser] -->|SSE Connection| SSE[StorefrontHub /sse/storefront]
    Browser -->|HTTP GET| Queries[Query Endpoints]
    
    SSE -->|Push events| EventBroadcaster[EventBroadcaster Channel-based pub/sub]
    
    Queries -->|HTTP GET| Shopping[Shopping BC API]
    Queries -->|HTTP GET| Orders[Orders BC API]
    Queries -->|HTTP GET| Catalog[Catalog BC API]
    Queries -->|HTTP GET| CustomerIdentity[Customer Identity BC API]
    
    RabbitMQ[RabbitMQ Queues] -->|Integration Events| Handlers[Notification Handlers]
    Handlers -->|Publish| EventBroadcaster
    
    subgraph "Customer Experience BFF"
        SSE
        Queries
        EventBroadcaster
        Handlers
    end
    
    subgraph "Downstream BCs"
        Shopping
        Orders
        Catalog
        CustomerIdentity
    end
```

### Key Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **StorefrontHub** | SSE Endpoint | Streams real-time events to browser (`/sse/storefront`) |
| **EventBroadcaster** | In-Memory Pub/Sub | Channel-based broadcaster (fan-out to multiple clients) |
| **Notification Handlers** | Integration Message Handlers | Subscribe to RabbitMQ, transform to `StorefrontEvent`, publish to broadcaster |
| **Query Endpoints** | HTTP GET Handlers | Compose views by calling downstream BC APIs (Shopping, Orders, Catalog) |
| **HTTP Clients** | `I*Client` Interfaces | Typed HTTP clients for downstream BCs (injected via DI) |

---

## 2. Real-Time Notification Flow

### SSE Broadcast Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser as Blazor Web (Browser)
    participant SSE as StorefrontHub (SSE)
    participant Broadcaster as EventBroadcaster
    participant Handler as ItemAddedHandler
    participant RabbitMQ as RabbitMQ Queue
    participant Shopping as Shopping BC
    
    Note over Browser: User connects to BFF
    Browser->>SSE: GET /sse/storefront (EventSource)
    SSE->>Broadcaster: Subscribe to channel
    Note over SSE: Long-lived connection established
    
    Note over Shopping: User adds item to cart
    Shopping->>Shopping: Append ItemAdded event
    Shopping->>RabbitMQ: Publish ItemAdded (integration)
    
    RabbitMQ->>Handler: Deliver ItemAdded message
    Handler->>Handler: Transform to CartUpdated (StorefrontEvent)
    Handler->>Broadcaster: Publish CartUpdated
    
    Broadcaster->>SSE: Fan-out to all subscribers
    SSE->>Browser: SSE event: data: {"eventType":"cart-updated",...}
    
    Note over Browser: Blazor updates UI reactively
```

### StorefrontEvent Discriminated Union

```csharp
[JsonPolymorphic(TypeDiscriminatorPropertyName = "eventType")]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(CartUpdated), typeDiscriminator: "cart-updated")]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(OrderStatusChanged), typeDiscriminator: "order-status-changed")]
[JsonDerivedType(typeof(ShipmentStatusChanged), typeDiscriminator: "shipment-status-changed")]
public abstract record StorefrontEvent(DateTimeOffset OccurredAt);

public sealed record CartUpdated(
    Guid CartId,
    Guid CustomerId,
    int ItemCount,
    decimal TotalAmount,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : StorefrontEvent(OccurredAt);

public sealed record OrderStatusChanged(
    Guid OrderId,
    Guid CustomerId,
    string NewStatus, // "Placed", "PaymentCaptured", "Shipped", "Delivered"
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : StorefrontEvent(OccurredAt);

public sealed record ShipmentStatusChanged(
    Guid ShipmentId,
    Guid OrderId,
    Guid CustomerId,
    string NewStatus,
    string? TrackingNumber,
    DateTimeOffset OccurredAt) : StorefrontEvent(OccurredAt);
```

## 3. Integration Event Handlers

### Notification Handlers (RabbitMQ Subscribers)

| Handler | Subscribes To | Produces | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| `ItemAddedHandler` | `Shopping.ItemAdded` | `CartUpdated` | ✅ Complete |
| `ItemQuantityChangedHandler` | `Shopping.ItemQuantityChanged` | `CartUpdated` | ✅ Complete |
| `ItemRemovedHandler` | `Shopping.ItemRemoved` | `CartUpdated` | ✅ Complete |
| `OrderPlacedHandler` | `Orders.OrderPlaced` | `OrderStatusChanged` | ✅ Complete |
| `PaymentAuthorizedHandler` | `Payments.PaymentAuthorized` | `OrderStatusChanged` | ✅ Complete |
| `ReservationConfirmedHandler` | `Inventory.ReservationConfirmed` | `OrderStatusChanged` | ✅ Complete |
| `ShipmentDispatchedHandler` | `Fulfillment.ShipmentDispatched` | `ShipmentStatusChanged` | ✅ Complete |

### Implementation Pattern

```csharp
public sealed class ItemAddedHandler
{
    private readonly IEventBroadcaster _broadcaster;

    public ItemAddedHandler(IEventBroadcaster broadcaster)
    {
        _broadcaster = broadcaster;
    }

    public async Task Handle(Messages.Contracts.Shopping.ItemAdded message, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Transform integration message → StorefrontEvent
        var storefrontEvent = new CartUpdated(
            message.CartId,
            message.CustomerId,
            message.ItemCount,
            message.TotalAmount,
            message.OccurredAt);

        // Broadcast to all connected SSE clients
        await _broadcaster.BroadcastAsync(storefrontEvent, ct);
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Query Composition Pattern

### View Composition (Example: CartView)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser as Blazor Web
    participant BFF as Storefront BFF
    participant Shopping as Shopping BC
    participant Catalog as Product Catalog BC
    
    Browser->>BFF: GET /api/carts/{customerId}/view
    
    BFF->>Shopping: GET /api/carts/{customerId}
    Shopping-->>BFF: Cart { Items: [{ SKU, Qty, Price }] }
    
    loop For each SKU in cart
        BFF->>Catalog: GET /api/products/{sku}
        Catalog-->>BFF: Product { Name, Description, ImageUrl }
    end
    
    BFF->>BFF: Compose CartView (merge cart + product details)
    BFF-->>Browser: CartView { Items: [{ Name, ImageUrl, Qty, Price }] }
```

### Query Endpoint Example

```csharp
[WolverineGet("/api/carts/{customerId:guid}/view")]
public static async Task<CartView> GetCartView(
    Guid customerId,
    IShoppingClient shoppingClient,
    IProductCatalogClient catalogClient,
    CancellationToken ct)
{
    // 1. Fetch cart from Shopping BC
    var cart = await shoppingClient.GetCartAsync(customerId, ct);
    if (cart is null)
        return CartView.Empty;

    // 2. Fetch product details for each SKU
    var productTasks = cart.Items.Select(item => 
        catalogClient.GetProductAsync(item.Sku, ct));
    var products = await Task.WhenAll(productTasks);

    // 3. Compose view model
    var items = cart.Items.Zip(products, (cartItem, product) => new CartItemView(
        product.Sku,
        product.Name,
        product.ImageUrl,
        cartItem.Quantity,
        cartItem.UnitPrice));

    return new CartView(cart.CartId, customerId, items, cart.TotalAmount);
}
```

---

## 6. What's Missing (Engineering Gaps)

### Critical Gaps (P0)

1. **❌ Customer Isolation (Multi-Tenancy)**
   - **Problem:** SSE broadcasts to ALL connected clients (no filtering by CustomerId)
   - **Impact:** Customer A sees Customer B's cart updates (privacy breach)
   - **Fix:** Add customer filtering to EventBroadcaster (Cycle 19)
   - **Priority:** 🔴 **Blocker for production** - Security issue

2. **❌ Real HTTP Client Implementations**
   - **Problem:** Stub clients return hardcoded data (not calling downstream APIs)
   - **Impact:** Query endpoints return fake data
   - **Fix:** Implement typed HTTP clients with Refit or HttpClient (Cycle 19)
   - **Priority:** 🔴 **Blocker for production**

3. **❌ Authentication**
   - **Problem:** No JWT validation; customer ID passed in query params (spoofable)
   - **Impact:** Anyone can access any customer's data
   - **Fix:** Add JWT middleware, extract customer ID from token (Cycle 20)
   - **Priority:** 🔴 **Critical** - Security issue

### High Priority Gaps (P1)

4. **❌ SSE Reconnection Handling**
   - **Problem:** If SSE connection drops, client reconnects but misses events during outage
   - **Impact:** UI becomes stale (cart shows wrong item count until page refresh)
   - **Fix:** Add event replay (last-event-id header, persistent event log)
   - **Priority:** 🟡 **High** - UX issue

5. **❌ Error Handling in Queries**
   - **Problem:** If downstream BC is down, query throws 500 (no graceful degradation)
   - **Impact:** Entire page fails to load
   - **Fix:** Circuit breaker + fallback responses (Polly library) (Cycle 21)
   - **Priority:** 🟡 **High** - Resilience

6. **❌ Query Caching**
   - **Problem:** Every page load fetches fresh data from downstream BCs
   - **Impact:** High latency and load on downstream APIs
   - **Fix:** Add Redis cache with short TTL (30 seconds) (Cycle 22)
   - **Priority:** 🟡 **Medium** - Performance

### Medium Priority Gaps (P2)

7. **❌ CheckoutView / OrderView Composition**
   - **Problem:** Only CartView implemented (checkout/order views stubbed)
   - **Impact:** Cannot test full customer journey
   - **Fix:** Implement remaining query compositions (Cycle 20)
   - **Priority:** 🟢 **Medium** - Feature completeness

8. **❌ SSE Heartbeat**
   - **Problem:** No keepalive; proxies may close idle connections
   - **Impact:** SSE disconnects after 60 seconds of inactivity
   - **Fix:** Send `:ping\n\n` every 30 seconds (Cycle 21)
   - **Priority:** 🟢 **Medium** - UX improvement

9. **❌ OpenTelemetry Tracing**
   - **Problem:** No distributed tracing across BFF → downstream BCs
   - **Impact:** Hard to debug slow queries (which BC is bottleneck?)
   - **Fix:** Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation (Cycle 22)
   - **Priority:** 🟢 **Low** - Observability

10. **❌ Notification Delivery Guarantees**
    - **Problem:** In-memory broadcaster loses events if BFF crashes
    - **Impact:** Clients miss updates during BFF restarts
    - **Fix:** Persist events to Redis or DB (event replay) (Cycle 23)
    - **Priority:** 🟢 **Low** - Resilience

## 7. Business Questions for Product Owner

### Critical Decisions Needed

1. **SSE vs WebSockets:**
   - Q: Should we use SSE (current) or upgrade to WebSockets for bi-directional communication?
   - Current: SSE (server → client only, browser native, simpler)
   - Considerations:
     - SSE: Simpler, HTTP/2 compatible, browser native
     - WebSockets: Bi-directional, more complex, requires custom client
   - Engineering recommendation: **Stick with SSE** (sufficient for read-only notifications)
   - Impact: Affects mobile app integration (WebSockets required for React Native)

2. **Event Replay Duration:**
   - Q: How long should we retain events for replay after SSE reconnection?
   - Options:
     - A) No replay (current, lose events during outage)
     - B) 5 minutes (short window, minimal storage)
     - C) 1 hour (long window, more storage)
   - Engineering recommendation: **5 minutes** (covers typical network blips)
   - Impact: Affects Redis storage size

3. **Notification Types:**
   - Q: What other real-time updates do customers need?
   - Current: Cart, Order, Shipment
   - Potential additions:
     - Price changes on items in cart (dynamic pricing)
     - Low stock alerts ("Only 2 left!")
     - Recommended products (ML-driven)
     - Flash sales / limited-time offers
   - Impact: More notification handlers + more RabbitMQ subscriptions

4. **Query Composition Depth:**
   - Q: How deep should view composition go? (e.g., fetch product reviews in CartView?)
   - Current: Shallow (cart + basic product details)
   - Considerations:
     - Shallow: Fast, simple, fewer BC dependencies
     - Deep: Rich data, slower, more brittle (cascading failures)
   - Engineering recommendation: **Shallow by default**, deep only on-demand
   - Impact: Affects query latency

### Non-Critical (Future Cycles)

5. **Mobile App Support:**
   - Q: Will native mobile apps (iOS/Android) need real-time updates?
   - Current: Browser-only (SSE)
   - Impact: May need GraphQL subscriptions or WebSocket support

6. **Admin Portal:**
   - Q: Do support agents need real-time visibility into customer carts/orders?
   - Current: Customer-facing only
   - Impact: Separate admin BFF or extend existing (role-based filtering)

7. **Analytics Integration:**
   - Q: Should we stream events to analytics pipeline (Segment, Amplitude)?
   - Current: No analytics tracking
   - Impact: Add analytics adapter to EventBroadcaster

---

## 8. Testing Coverage

### Current Tests (Integration Tests)

**Tests Exist:** ⚠️ Minimal (`tests/Customer Experience/Storefront.IntegrationTests`)

| Test Category | Coverage | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| SSE connection establishment | ✅ | Pass |
| Cart notification broadcast | ✅ | Pass |
| Query composition (CartView) | ✅ | Pass |
| Multi-client SSE | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Customer isolation | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Downstream BC failure handling | ❌ | Not implemented |

### What's NOT Tested

- ❌ **Customer isolation** - Customer A shouldn't see Customer B's events
- ❌ **SSE reconnection** - Event replay after connection drop
- ❌ **Circuit breaker** - Graceful degradation when downstream BC fails
- ❌ **Concurrent connections** - 1000+ simultaneous SSE clients
- ❌ **Authentication** - JWT validation in queries
- ❌ **Query caching** - Redis cache hit/miss behavior

### Recommended Tests (Cycle 20)

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task sse_only_broadcasts_to_matching_customer()
{
    // Arrange: Two customers with SSE connections
    var client1 = await ConnectSSE(customerId: Guid.NewGuid());
    var client2 = await ConnectSSE(customerId: Guid.NewGuid());
    
    // Act: Customer 1 adds item to cart
    await PublishItemAdded(client1.CustomerId);
    await Task.Delay(500);
    
    // Assert: Only client1 receives event
    client1.ReceivedEvents.Count.ShouldBe(1);
    client2.ReceivedEvents.Count.ShouldBe(0);
}

[Fact]
public async Task query_returns_cached_response_on_downstream_failure()
{
    // Arrange: Prime cache with CartView
    var customerId = Guid.NewGuid();
    await GetCartView(customerId); // Populates cache
    
    // Act: Simulate Shopping BC outage
    _shoppingBcContainer.StopAsync();
    var view = await GetCartView(customerId);
    
    // Assert: Returns stale cache (not 500 error)
    view.ShouldNotBeNull();
    view.IsStale.ShouldBeTrue(); // Flag indicates cache hit
}

[Fact]
public async Task sse_replays_events_after_reconnection()
{
    // Arrange: Client connects, receives event, disconnects
    var client = await ConnectSSE(customerId: Guid.NewGuid());
    await PublishItemAdded(client.CustomerId);
    var lastEventId = client.LastReceivedEventId;
    await client.DisconnectAsync();
    
    // Act: Publish another event while disconnected
    await PublishItemRemoved(client.CustomerId);
    
    // Act: Reconnect with last-event-id
    await client.ReconnectAsync(lastEventId);
    
    // Assert: Receives missed event
    await Eventually(() => client.ReceivedEvents.Count == 2, timeout: 5.Seconds());
}
```
