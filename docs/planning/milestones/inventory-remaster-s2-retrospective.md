## Test Delta

| Suite | S1 Baseline | S2 Final | Delta |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Inventory unit tests | 83 | 100 | +17 |
| Inventory integration tests | 54 | 83 | +29 |
| Orders integration tests | 55 | 55 | 0 |
| Orders unit tests | 144 | 144 | 0 |

## Build/Test Status

- Build: **0 errors**, ≤4 warnings (same as S1 baseline)
- All 4 test suites: **green**

## Gap #13 Resolution: ConcurrencyException + `.Discard()` Policy

### Findings

The concurrent reservation test (Slice 17) confirms:

1. When two `StockReservationRequested` messages arrive simultaneously for the same
   inventory stream with exactly enough stock for one:
   - The first reservation succeeds (appends `StockReserved`)
   - The second hits a `ConcurrencyException` on retry
   - Wolverine retries once, then retries with cooldown (100ms, 250ms)
   - If stock is still insufficient after retry, the message is **silently discarded**

2. The second order **never receives `ReservationFailed`** — it's simply dropped.

### Current Policy (unchanged in this session)

```csharp
opts.OnException<ConcurrencyException>()
    .RetryOnce()
    .Then.RetryWithCooldown(100.Milliseconds(), 250.Milliseconds())
    .Then.Discard();
```

### Recommendation for S3

Change from `.Discard()` to `.MoveToDeadLetterQueue()` for visibility. This is a
non-trivial change because:
- Dead letter queue handlers need to be created
- Monitoring/alerting needs to be added
- The `Before()` validation on `StockReservationRequestedHandler` properly rejects
  insufficient stock, so the retry path usually succeeds (the concurrency conflict
  is on the event append, not the validation)

The risk of silent drops is **low but non-zero** in the current architecture. When
the Fulfillment routing engine sends `StockReservationRequested` to a specific
warehouse, it already checked `StockAvailabilityView` for availability. The main
risk vector is flash sales where availability drops between the routing query and
the reservation command.

**Decision: Defer `.MoveToDeadLetterQueue()` to S3** — document as known limitation.

## Integration Contract Changes

### New Contracts
- `Messages.Contracts.Fulfillment.ItemPicked` — Gap #11 enrichment (WarehouseId, OrderId)
- `Messages.Contracts.Inventory.BackorderStockAvailable` — new outbound

### Modified Contracts
- `Messages.Contracts.Fulfillment.BackorderCreated` — Gap #10 enrichment (Items list)

### Queue Subscriptions
- `inventory-fulfillment-events`: now handles `StockReservationRequested`,
  `ShipmentHandedToCarrier`, `ItemPicked`, `BackorderCreated`

## New Domain Events

| Event | Slice | State Change |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `StockPicked` | 13 | Committed → Picked |
| `StockShipped` | 14 | Picked removed, TotalOnHand decremented |
| `StockDiscrepancyFound` | 15 | None (audit only) |
| `ReservationExpired` | 16 | Same as ReservationReleased |
| `BackorderRegistered` | 18 | HasPendingBackorders = true |
| `BackorderCleared` | 19 | HasPendingBackorders = false |
| `CycleCountInitiated` | 20 | None |
| `CycleCountCompleted` | 21 | None (via InventoryAdjusted) |
| `DamageRecorded` | 23 | None (via InventoryAdjusted) |
| `StockWrittenOff` | 24 | None (via InventoryAdjusted) |

---

## Technical Decisions

1. **ShipmentHandedToCarrierHandler Load pattern**: Uses Marten `MatchesSql` with
   `jsonb_each_text` for dictionary value lookup — LINQ `Dictionary.Values.Contains()`
   not supported by Marten.

2. **BackorderCreatedHandler**: Handles multi-item backorders by iterating through
   items and appending per-stream events. Does not use the aggregate Load/Handle
   pattern because it touches multiple streams.

3. **CycleCount negative rejection**: `CompleteCycleCountHandler.Before()` rejects
   counts that would push AvailableQuantity negative — operations manager must
   investigate discrepancy before adjusting.

4. **LowStockPolicy inline calls**: RecordDamage, WriteOffStock, and CycleCount
   use inline `LowStockPolicy.CrossedThresholdDownward()` checks and append
   `LowStockThresholdBreached` domain events — same pattern as S1.

## Deferred Items

- **Gap #13 `.MoveToDeadLetterQueue()`** — deferred to S3 (see resolution above)
- **AlertFeedView integration event for StockDiscrepancyFound** — marked TODO in
  ItemPickedHandler; deferred to S3 when AlertFeedView projection is built
- **HTTP endpoint wiring for CycleCount, RecordDamage, WriteOffStock** — handlers
  exist but Wolverine HTTP `[WolverinePost]` attributes not yet added; deferred to
  S3 or API surface cleanup pass
