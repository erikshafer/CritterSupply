# Development Guidelines for CritterSupply with Claude

This repository demonstrates how to build robust, production-ready, event-driven systems using a realistic e-commerce domain.

It serves as a reference architecture for idiomatically leveraging the "Critter Stack"—[Wolverine](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine) and [Marten](https://github.com/JasperFx/marten)—to supercharge your .NET development.

> **Universal Applicability**: While demonstrated in C#/.NET, these patterns apply to any language. Concepts are influenced by pragmatic Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and CQRS.

## Quick Start (First 5 Minutes)

**New to CritterSupply? Start here:**

1. **Understand what you're looking at:**
   - Monorepo with 11+ bounded contexts (BCs) under `src/`
   - Event-driven architecture using Marten (event sourcing) + Wolverine (message handling)
   - Each BC has a domain project + optional `.Api` project

2. **Run the system locally:**
   ```bash
   # Start infrastructure (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Jaeger)
   docker-compose --profile infrastructure up -d

   # Run a service natively (fast, hot reload, debuggable)
   dotnet run --project "src/Customer Experience/Storefront.Web/Storefront.Web.csproj"

   # OR run everything in containers (full stack demo)
   docker-compose --profile all up --build
   ```

3. **Key files to orient yourself:**
   - **[CONTEXTS.md](./CONTEXTS.md)** — What each BC owns and who it talks to
   - **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** — 5-minute quick guide (exact commands, copy-paste snippets)
   - **[docs/skills/README.md](./docs/skills/README.md)** — Implementation patterns by use case

4. **Before implementing anything:**
   - Check [CONTEXTS.md](./CONTEXTS.md) for BC boundaries
   - Read the relevant skill file from [docs/skills/](./docs/skills/) (see [Skill Invocation Guide](#skill-invocation-guide))
   - Look for existing examples in the codebase (code is the source of truth)

5. **Common first tasks:**
   - Adding a command handler? → Read `docs/skills/wolverine-message-handlers.md`
   - Creating a saga? → Read `docs/skills/wolverine-sagas.md`
   - Adding a new BC? → Read `docs/skills/adding-new-bounded-context.md`
   - Writing tests? → Read `docs/skills/critterstack-testing-patterns.md`

**Still confused?** See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for copy-paste snippets showing exact wiring patterns.

## CritterSupply

CritterSupply is a fictional pet supply retailer—the name a playful nod to the Critter Stack powering it, with the tagline "Stocked for every season."

E-commerce was chosen because it's a domain most developers intuitively understand. Nearly everyone has placed an order online. That familiarity lets us focus on *how* the system is built rather than explaining *what* it does.

---

## Architectural North Star

**IMPORTANT:** `CONTEXTS.md` is a **single-file, at-a-glance reference** for all bounded contexts — what each BC owns, which adjacent BCs it communicates with, and non-obvious constraints. It is not a specification.

**Code is the source of truth** for events, commands, handlers, and message contracts. `CONTEXTS.md` answers *"what does this BC own and who does it talk to?"* — nothing more.

When implementing integrations between bounded contexts:

1. **Consult CONTEXTS.md for orientation** — It shows BC ownership and communication directions
2. **Consult the codebase for contracts** — Events, commands, and message shapes live in code (especially `src/Shared/Messages.Contracts/` and BC handler files)
3. **Do not add implementation details to CONTEXTS.md** — If something requires ongoing updates to stay accurate, it does not belong there

---

## Documentation Hierarchy

**AI agents: follow this hierarchy when seeking information:**

```
Code (src/, tests/)                     ← Source of truth for all implementation details
    ↑
CONTEXTS.md                             ← BC ownership, integration directions
    ↑
CLAUDE.md (this file)                   ← Development workflows, tool configuration
    ↑
docs/skills/*.md                        ← Implementation patterns (read on demand)
    ↑
docs/decisions/*.md (ADRs)              ← Architectural decisions with rationale
    ↑
docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md          ← Active work tracking
```

**When in doubt:** Read code first, then CONTEXTS.md, then skill files. Documentation describes patterns; code shows reality.

## Glossary

**Core Domain Concepts:**

- **Aggregate** — Boundary for atomic transactions. Event-sourced aggregates are reconstituted from their event stream. Example: `Order`, `ShoppingCart`.

- **Bounded Context (BC)** — Logical boundary within which domain terms have consistent meaning. Each BC is a separate folder under `src/`. Example: `Orders`, `Payments`, `Shopping`.

- **BFF (Backend-for-Frontend)** — API layer tailored to a specific UI. Composes data from multiple BCs. Examples: `Storefront.Api` (customer-facing), `VendorPortal.Api` (vendor-facing).

- **Choreography** — Integration pattern where BCs autonomously react to events from other BCs. No central orchestrator. Example: Inventory reacts to `OrderPlaced`.

- **Command** — Imperative request to change state. Named with verbs: `PlaceOrder`, `AddItemToCart`, `CapturePayment`.

- **Event** — Immutable fact describing something that happened. Named with past tense: `OrderPlaced`, `ItemAddedToCart`, `PaymentCaptured`.

- **Event Sourcing** — Storing events as the source of truth instead of storing current state. Aggregates are reconstituted by replaying their event stream.

- **Integration Message** — Event published across BC boundaries via RabbitMQ. Defined in `src/Shared/Messages.Contracts/`.

- **Orchestration** — Integration pattern where one BC actively coordinates others (via commands/requests). Example: `OrderSaga` orchestrates `Payments`, `Inventory`, `Fulfillment`.

- **Projection** — Denormalized read model built from events. Can be in-memory, Marten document, or relational table (EF Core). Example: `OrderSummary` projection.

- **Query** — Read-only request for data. Examples: `GetOrderDetails`, `GetCartView`.

- **Saga** — Stateful orchestrator coordinating multiple BCs over time. Stored as a Marten document with numeric revisions for optimistic concurrency. Example: `OrderSaga`, `ReturnSaga`.

- **Snapshot** — Immutable data captured at a point in time to preserve temporal consistency. Example: Address at checkout, price at add-to-cart.

- **Value Object** — Immutable object without identity, defined by its properties. Examples: `Money`, `Address`, `OrderLineItem`.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Marten** — Event sourcing + document store library for Postgres. Used for event-sourced aggregates, sagas, and document storage.

- **Wolverine** — Message handling + orchestration library. Discovers handlers via convention, manages inbox/outbox, routes messages to RabbitMQ.

- **Alba** — Integration testing library built on ASP.NET Core's `TestServer`. Used for HTTP endpoint testing.

- **Reqnroll** — BDD testing framework (successor to SpecFlow). Executes Gherkin `.feature` files.

- **TestContainers** — Library for spinning up Docker containers in tests. Used for real Postgres/RabbitMQ infrastructure.

## Documentation Structure

CritterSupply uses a modular documentation structure optimized for AI-assisted development and reference architecture clarity.

### Planning & Progress Documentation

**⚠️ Migration in Progress (2026-02-23):** CritterSupply is moving from markdown-based planning to **GitHub Projects + Issues**. See [GITHUB-MIGRATION-PLAN.md](./docs/planning/GITHUB-MIGRATION-PLAN.md) and [ADR 0011](./docs/decisions/0011-github-projects-issues-migration.md).

**⚡ Planning Schema Update (2026-03-15):** CritterSupply has migrated from "Cycle N Phase M" to **Milestone-Based Versioning** (M.N format). See [ADR 0032](./docs/decisions/0032-milestone-based-planning-schema.md) and [Milestone Mapping](./docs/planning/milestone-mapping.md).

**Active Milestone Tracking (GitHub-First):**
- **GitHub Issues** — One Issue per task; label with `bc:*`, `type:*`, `priority:*`, `status:*`
- **GitHub Milestones** — One Milestone per deliverable (e.g., `M30.1: Promotions Redemption Workflow`)
- **GitHub Project Board** — Kanban board view with columns: Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done
- **[docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md](./docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md)** — Lightweight AI-readable summary (fallback when GitHub MCP not available)

**Why GitHub-first works across any machine (MacBook, Windows, Linux):**
Project state lives in GitHub's cloud, not in local files. Any machine with the GitHub MCP server configured and GitHub auth completed gets the same authoritative view of open issues, active milestones, and backlog — no stale markdown, no sync needed.

**Prerequisites per machine:**
- ✅ **GitHub MCP server** — configured in your AI tool's MCP settings (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- ✅ **GitHub auth** — personal access token with `repo` + `project` scopes
- See [GITHUB-ACCESS-GUIDE.md](./docs/planning/GITHUB-ACCESS-GUIDE.md) for complete setup instructions (PAT creation, MCP config JSON, domain allowlist, verification checklist)

**Legacy Markdown (Read-Only Archives):**
- **[docs/planning/CYCLES.md](./docs/planning/CYCLES.md)** — Historical cycle records (Cycles 1–18); **deprecated and outdated** — use CURRENT-CYCLE.md for active milestone tracking
- **[docs/planning/BACKLOG.md](./docs/planning/BACKLOG.md)** — Historical backlog; **deprecated** (items migrated to GitHub Issues)
- **[docs/planning/cycles/](./docs/planning/cycles/)** — Per-cycle retrospective docs; still created as markdown after each milestone
- **[docs/planning/milestone-mapping.md](./docs/planning/milestone-mapping.md)** — Maps legacy "Cycle N" identifiers to new milestone IDs

**When to Use What:**
- Starting a new milestone: Create GitHub Milestone + Issues; write `docs/planning/milestones/mNN.M-name.md` for detailed plan
- Tracking progress: Close GitHub Issues (use `Fixes #XX` in commits); GitHub Project board auto-updates
- Checking current state: Call `list_issues(milestone="M30.1")` OR read `docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md`
- Retrospective: Create markdown doc in `milestones/`; update `CURRENT-CYCLE.md`

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

**Location:** [docs/decisions/](./docs/decisions/)

**Format:** `NNNN-title.md` (e.g., `0004-sse-over-signalr.md`)

**Purpose:** Capture **why** we made key architectural choices without lengthy prose

**When to Create an ADR:**
- Technology selection decisions (SSE vs SignalR, EF Core vs Marten, etc.)
- Pattern/approach decisions (value objects vs primitives for queryable fields)
- Bounded context boundary changes (Checkout migration from Shopping to Orders)
- Integration pattern choices (orchestration vs choreography)

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR NNNN: Title

**Status:** ✅ Accepted / ⚠️ Proposed / ❌ Rejected / 🔄 Superseded

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Context:** [What problem are we solving? What constraints exist?]

**Decision:** [What did we decide?]

**Rationale:** [Why did we decide this? What are the benefits?]

**Consequences:** [What are the positive/negative outcomes? Trade-offs?]

**Alternatives Considered:** [What other options did we evaluate? Why rejected?]

**References:** [Links to cycle plans, CONTEXTS.md sections, skills docs]
```

**Existing ADRs:**
- [ADR 0001: Checkout Migration to Orders](./docs/decisions/0001-checkout-migration-to-orders.md) (Cycle 8)
- [ADR 0002: EF Core for Customer Identity](./docs/decisions/0002-ef-core-for-customer-identity.md) (Cycle 13)
- [ADR 0003: Value Objects vs Primitives for Queryable Fields](./docs/decisions/0003-value-objects-vs-primitives-queryable-fields.md) (Cycle 14)
- [ADR 0004: SSE over SignalR](./docs/decisions/0004-sse-over-signalr.md) (Cycle 16)

### BDD Feature Specifications (Gherkin)

**Location:** [docs/features/](./docs/features/)

**Organization:** One subdirectory per bounded context (e.g., `docs/features/shopping/`, `docs/features/customer-experience/`)

**Purpose:** Capture user-facing behavior in Given/When/Then format **before** implementation

**Benefits:**
- **Living Documentation:** Features describe system capabilities from user perspective
- **Test Generation:** Can scaffold integration tests from Gherkin scenarios
- **Clarity:** Forces thinking about user value before writing code
- **Reference Architecture Value:** Shows BDD practices for developers learning from CritterSupply

**When to Create Feature Files:**
- Before starting a milestone: Write 2-3 `.feature` files for key user stories
- During implementation: Reference scenarios as acceptance criteria for integration tests
- After completion: Feature files serve as living documentation (verified by tests)

**Gherkin Template:**
```gherkin
Feature: Feature Name
  As a [user type]
  I want to [action]
  So that [business value]

  Background:
    Given [common setup for all scenarios]

  Scenario: Happy path scenario name
    Given [precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [expected outcome]
    And [additional assertion]

  Scenario: Edge case scenario name
    Given [different precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [different expected outcome]
```

**Feature File Organization:**
```
docs/features/
├── shopping/
│   ├── cart-management.feature
│   └── checkout-wizard.feature
├── orders/
│   ├── order-placement.feature
│   └── order-saga-orchestration.feature
├── customer-experience/
│   ├── product-browsing.feature
│   ├── cart-real-time-updates.feature
│   └── checkout-flow.feature
└── [other BCs]/
```

### Workflow for New Milestones

**Before Starting a Milestone (Planning Phase):**
1. Create GitHub Milestone: `M<N>.<M>: <Short Description>` with target due date (e.g., `M30.1: Promotions Redemption Workflow`)
2. Create parent "Milestone Epic" Issue linked to Milestone
3. Create individual task Issues (linked to Milestone) using labels: `bc:*`, `type:feature`, `priority:*`
4. Write 2-3 Gherkin `.feature` files for key user stories
5. Create ADR markdown file + companion GitHub Issue for architectural decisions
6. Review `CONTEXTS.md` for BC ownership and communication directions
7. Update `docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md` with new milestone info

**During a Milestone (Implementation Phase):**
1. Implement features using `.feature` files as acceptance criteria
2. Write integration tests verifying Gherkin scenarios
3. Close Issues via `Fixes #XX` in commit messages (or PR description)
4. Comment on Issues with implementation notes / blockers
5. Create ADR markdown file when making architectural decisions

**After Completing a Milestone (Retrospective Phase):**
1. Close GitHub Milestone (records completion date)
2. Export closed Issues to markdown for fork compatibility:
   `bash scripts/github-migration/04-export-cycle.sh "M30.1: Promotions Redemption Workflow"`
   Then commit the exported file (`docs/planning/milestones/m30.1-issues-export.md`)
3. Update `CONTEXTS.md` only if BC ownership or communication directions changed (not for implementation details)
4. Create retrospective doc: `docs/planning/milestones/m30.1-retrospective.md`
5. Update `docs/planning/CURRENT-CYCLE.md` to next milestone

### Legacy Documentation

**DEVPROGRESS.md** — Deprecated as of 2026-02-04. Kept for historical reference only.

**docs/planning/CYCLES.md** — Deprecated as of 2026-02-23 and no longer maintained. Use **CURRENT-CYCLE.md** for active cycle tracking. CYCLES.md kept as historical archive (Cycles 1–18) but is outdated.

**docs/planning/BACKLOG.md** — Deprecated as of 2026-02-23 (migrated to GitHub Issues). Kept as historical reference.

## Quick References

### Preferred Tools

- **Language**: C# 14+ (.NET 10+)
- **Testing**: xUnit, Testcontainers, Alba, Shouldly
- **Validation**: FluentValidation
- **Serialization**: System.Text.Json
- **Database**: Postgres
- **Event Sourcing / Document Store**: Marten 8+
- **Message Handling**: Wolverine 5+
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ (AMQP)
- **Local Orchestration**: Docker Compose (primary), .NET Aspire 13.1+ (optional)
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger

### Manual Testing

For manual API testing using `.http` files in JetBrains IDEs, see **[docs/HTTP-FILES-GUIDE.md](./docs/HTTP-FILES-GUIDE.md)**.

Each bounded context API includes a comprehensive `.http` file with test scenarios, assertions, and RabbitMQ integration verification.

### Core Principles

- **Pure functions for business logic** — Handlers should be pure; side effects at the edges
- **Immutability by default** — Use records, `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `with` expressions
- **Sealed by default** — All commands, queries, events, and models are `sealed`
- **Integration tests over unit tests** — Test complete vertical slices with Alba
- **A-Frame architecture** — Infrastructure at edges, pure logic in the middle
- **Always update .sln** — When creating new projects, immediately add them to `CritterSupply.sln` using `dotnet sln add`

## Solution Organization

```
src/
  <Bounded Context Name>/
    <ProjectName>/                    # Domain + handlers (Web SDK)
    <ProjectName>.Api/                # [Optional] Separate API project
tests/
  <Bounded Context Name>/
    <ProjectName>.IntegrationTests/
    <ProjectName>.UnitTests/          # [Optional]
```

**Real Examples:**
```

  Orders/Orders/, Orders.Api/
  Payments/Payments/, Payments.Api/
  Shopping/Shopping/, Shopping.Api/
  Inventory/Inventory/, Inventory.Api/
  Fulfillment/Fulfillment/, Fulfillment.Api/
  Product Catalog/ProductCatalog/, ProductCatalog.Api/
  Customer Experience/Storefront/, Storefront.Api/, Storefront.Web/
  Shared/Messages.Contracts/
```

See `docs/skills/vertical-slice-organization.md` for complete file organization patterns.

---

## API Project Configuration

When creating a new API project (e.g., `Orders.Api`, `Payments.Api`), ensure these configurations are in place:

### 1. Connection String (appsettings.json)

**Standard format:**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "marten": "Host=localhost;Port=5433;Database=postgres;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Host**: `localhost` (for local development with docker-compose)
- **Port**: `5433` (docker-compose maps container's 5432 → host's 5433)
- **Database**: `postgres` (single shared database)
- **Schema**: Each BC uses its own schema via `opts.DatabaseSchemaName = Constants.<BcName>.ToLowerInvariant()`

**EF Core Projects** use `"postgres"` as the connection string name instead of `"marten"`.

### 2. Launch Settings (Properties/launchSettings.json)

**Required:** Each API project MUST have a `Properties/launchSettings.json` file with a unique port.

**Standard format:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "<BcName>Api": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "launchUrl": "api",
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:52XX",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Port Allocation Table** (increment by 1 for each new BC):

| BC                                  | Port     | Status      | Folder Name                                      |

| **Correspondence**                  | **5248** | ✅ Assigned  | Correspondence/ (Cycle 28)                       |
| **Admin Identity**                  | **5249** | ✅ Assigned  | Admin Identity/ (Cycle 29)                       |
| **Promotions**                      | **5250** | ✅ Assigned  | Promotions/ (Cycle 29 Phase 2)                   |

**Why this matters:**
- Allows running multiple APIs simultaneously during development
- Prevents port conflicts when debugging in IDE
- Enables easy service discovery during local integration testing

**When creating a new BC:** Check the port allocation table above and use the next available port number.

### 3. BFF Project Structure Pattern

**IMPORTANT:** Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) projects follow the **same domain/API split pattern** as all other bounded contexts.

**BFF Anatomy:**

```
src/<BC Name>/
├── <ProjectName>/                      # Domain project (regular SDK)
│   ├── <ProjectName>.csproj            # References: Messages.Contracts only
│   ├── Clients/                        # HTTP client interfaces (domain)
│   │   └── I*Client.cs
│   ├── Composition/                    # View models for UI
│   │   └── *View.cs
│   ├── Notifications/                  # Integration message handlers
│   │   └── *Handler.cs                 # Wolverine handlers for RabbitMQ messages
│   └── RealTime/                       # SignalR transport types
│       ├── IStorefrontWebSocketMessage.cs  # Marker interface for SignalR routing
│       └── StorefrontEvent.cs          # Discriminated union for real-time events
│
└── <ProjectName>.Api/                  # API project (Web SDK)
    ├── <ProjectName>.Api.csproj        # References: <ProjectName>, Messages.Contracts
    ├── Program.cs                      # Wolverine + Marten + DI setup
    ├── appsettings.json                # Connection strings
    ├── Properties/launchSettings.json  # Port allocation
    ├── Queries/                        # HTTP endpoints (composition)
    │   └── Get*View.cs                 # namespace: <ProjectName>.Api.Queries
    ├── Clients/                        # HTTP client implementations
    │   └── *Client.cs                  # namespace: <ProjectName>.Api.Clients
    └── *Hub.cs                         # SignalR hub (namespace: <ProjectName>.Api)
```

**Example: Customer Experience BFF (Storefront)**

```
src/Customer Experience/
├── Storefront/                         # Domain project
│   ├── Clients/                        # Interfaces for Shopping, Orders, Catalog, etc.
│   ├── Composition/                    # CartView, CheckoutView, ProductListingView
│   ├── Notifications/                  # ItemAddedHandler, OrderPlacedHandler, ShipmentDispatchedHandler, etc.
│   └── RealTime/                       # IStorefrontWebSocketMessage, StorefrontEvent
│
└── Storefront.Api/                     # API project
    ├── Program.cs                      # Wolverine handler discovery for both assemblies
    ├── Queries/                        # GetCartView, GetCheckoutView, GetProductListing
    ├── Clients/                        # ShoppingClient, OrdersClient, CatalogClient
    └── StorefrontHub.cs                # SignalR hub at /hub/storefront
```

**Key Configuration (Program.cs):**

```csharp
// Discover handlers in both API and Domain assemblies
builder.Host.UseWolverine(opts =>
{
    // API assembly (Queries)
    opts.Discovery.IncludeAssembly(typeof(Program).Assembly);

    // Domain assembly (Integration message handlers)
    opts.Discovery.IncludeAssembly(typeof(Storefront.RealTime.IStorefrontWebSocketMessage).Assembly);
});
```

**Why This Pattern:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Domain logic (composition, notification handling) separate from infrastructure (HTTP, DI)
- **Testability:** Test project references API project (brings in domain transitively)
- **Consistency:** BFF follows same pattern as Orders, Shopping, Payments, etc.
- **Namespace Clarity:** `<ProjectName>.*` for domain, `<ProjectName>.Api.*` for infrastructure

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Single Web SDK project combining domain + infrastructure
- ❌ Domain project referencing Wolverine packages (not needed - handlers discovered via API assembly reference)
- ❌ Forgetting to include domain assembly in `opts.Discovery.IncludeAssembly()`

## Local Development Options

CritterSupply supports **three development workflows**: Docker Compose + dotnet run (primary), .NET Aspire (optional), and fully containerized (Docker Compose only).

### Docker Compose + dotnet run (⭐ Recommended)

**The default workflow for CritterSupply:**

```bash
# Start infrastructure only
docker-compose --profile infrastructure up -d

# Run individual services as needed
dotnet run --project "src/Customer Experience/Storefront.Web/Storefront.Web.csproj"
```

**Why this is the default:**
- ✅ **Zero additional setup** - Just Docker Desktop + .NET 10
- ✅ **Fastest hot reload** - Native .NET process, not containerized
- ✅ **Best debugging** - F5 in Rider/Visual Studio works seamlessly
- ✅ **Lower memory** - Only infrastructure in containers (~300MB vs ~2GB)
- ✅ **Full IDE tooling** - Profilers, diagnostics, live unit testing all work

**When to use:** Daily feature development, debugging, iterative coding

---

### .NET Aspire (Optional - Enhanced Observability)

**For developers who want unified observability:**

```bash
# Step 1: Start infrastructure with fixed ports
docker-compose --profile infrastructure up -d

# Step 2: Start all 9 services via Aspire
dotnet run --project src/CritterSupply.AppHost

# Aspire Dashboard: http://localhost:15000
# Storefront Web: http://localhost:5238
```

**What Aspire adds:**
- ✅ **Unified dashboard** - Live logs, traces, metrics, health checks for all .NET services
- ✅ **One command** - Starts all 9 .NET services (vs 9 manual `dotnet run` commands)
- ✅ **Service discovery** - Automatic HTTP endpoint discovery for service-to-service calls
- ✅ **Demo-friendly** - Polished UI for showcasing system to stakeholders

**Why Aspire is optional:**
- Docker Compose provides all functionality needed for development
- Aspire adds learning curve and additional concepts
- Most developers prefer native debugging over containerized orchestration

**When to use:** Demos, exploring OpenTelemetry patterns, unified observability

**See [docs/ASPIRE-GUIDE.md](./docs/ASPIRE-GUIDE.md) for complete Aspire documentation.**

---

### Fully Containerized (Demos & Onboarding)

**Run entire stack in Docker containers:**

```bash
# Start infrastructure + all 8 APIs + Blazor web in containers
docker-compose --profile all up --build
```

**Start selective services:**
```bash
# Infrastructure + specific BCs
docker-compose --profile infrastructure --profile orders --profile shopping up

# Infrastructure + all APIs (no Blazor web)
docker-compose --profile infrastructure --profile orders --profile payments --profile inventory --profile fulfillment --profile customeridentity --profile shopping --profile catalog --profile storefront up
```

**When to use:**
- Onboarding new developers (no .NET SDK required on host)
- Demonstrating full system to stakeholders
- Cross-BC integration testing without running services natively
- Simulating production-like networking

---

### Docker Compose Profiles

| Profile            | Services Started                         | Use Case                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `infrastructure`   | Postgres + RabbitMQ                      | Native development (default) |
| `all`              | All infrastructure + 8 APIs + Blazor web | Full system demo, onboarding |
| `orders`           | Orders.Api                               | Selective service testing    |
| `payments`         | Payments.Api                             | Selective service testing    |
| `inventory`        | Inventory.Api                            | Selective service testing    |
| `fulfillment`      | Fulfillment.Api                          | Selective service testing    |
| `customeridentity` | CustomerIdentity.Api                     | Selective service testing    |
| `shopping`         | Shopping.Api                             | Selective service testing    |
| `catalog`          | ProductCatalog.Api                       | Selective service testing    |
| `storefront`       | Storefront.Api                           | Selective service testing    |
| `ci`               | Infrastructure only                      | CI/CD pipelines              |

**Combine profiles:**
```bash
docker-compose --profile infrastructure --profile orders up
```

---

### Dockerfile Maintenance

**When to rebuild container images:**
- After modifying `Directory.Packages.props` (package version changes)
- After adding/removing project references
- After modifying `Program.cs` or DI registrations
- After changing Marten/Wolverine configuration

**Force rebuild:**
```bash
docker-compose --profile all up --build
```

**Clean build (remove cached layers):**
```bash
docker-compose --profile all build --no-cache
```

---

### Connection String Differences

**IMPORTANT:** Connection strings differ between native and containerized development.

| Environment | Postgres Host | Postgres Port | RabbitMQ Host | RabbitMQ Port |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Native Development** | `localhost` | `5433` | `localhost` | `5672` |
| **Containerized** | `postgres` | `5432` | `rabbitmq` | `5672` |

**Why?**
- **Native:** APIs run on host, connect to containerized Postgres/RabbitMQ via localhost:5433
- **Containerized:** APIs run in containers, use Docker service names (`postgres`, `rabbitmq`) for inter-container communication

**Implementation:**
- `appsettings.json` uses `localhost:5433` (native default)
- `docker-compose.yml` overrides connection strings with environment variables (`postgres:5432`)

---

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Container builds fail with "file not found" errors
**Solution:** Ensure `.dockerignore` excludes `bin/`, `obj/`, `tests/` folders

**Problem:** Containers start but APIs return 500 errors
**Solution:** Check connection strings in `docker-compose.yml` environment variables

**Problem:** Hot reload doesn't work in containers
**Solution:** Use native development for iterative coding. Containers are for demos/integration testing.

**Problem:** Ports already in use
**Solution:** Stop other containers or change port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`

**Problem:** High memory usage with all containers
**Solution:** Use selective profiles or native development. Full stack requires ~2-3GB RAM.

## How Skill Files Work with AI Agents

**For AI agents reading this file:** This `CLAUDE.md` is your automatically-loaded configuration. Individual skill files (in `docs/skills/`) are **not** auto-loaded — you must proactively fetch them using your file-reading tools when the Skill Invocation Guide below says to do so.

**For humans configuring AI tools:**

| Tool | How skill files reach the AI |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Copilot Coding Agent** (GitHub Issues) | This file is auto-loaded; agent fetches skill files on demand based on guidance below |
| **Copilot Chat** (IDE) | Use `#file:docs/skills/your-skill.md` to explicitly include a skill |
| **Claude Desktop** (Project) | Upload skill `.md` files to Project Knowledge; copy this file into Project Instructions |
| **Any chat AI** (ad-hoc) | Copy-paste the relevant skill file content directly into your prompt |

See `docs/skills/README.md` → *"How AI Agents Use Skill Files"* for a full guide.

---

## Testing Strategy

**CritterSupply's testing pyramid:**

```
        E2E Tests (Playwright)           ← Real browser, full stack, Gherkin scenarios
       /                      \
      /                        \
    BDD Tests (Reqnroll)        ← Alba + TestContainers, Gherkin scenarios
   /                              \
  /                                \
Integration Tests (Alba)            ← HTTP endpoints, complete vertical slices
|                                    |
|                                    |
Unit Tests (xUnit)                   ← Pure function handlers, domain logic
```

### When to Use Each Test Type

**Unit Tests** — Fast, isolated, pure function testing
- **What:** Test handler logic in isolation (no DB, no HTTP, no external services)
- **When:** Handler is a pure function (input → output, no side effects)
- **Example:** `AddItemToCartHandler` logic, decider pattern functions
- **Tools:** xUnit, Shouldly
- **Speed:** < 100ms per test
- **Location:** `tests/*/UnitTests/` (optional — only if BC has significant pure logic)

**Integration Tests** — Real infrastructure, HTTP endpoints, complete workflows
- **What:** Test entire vertical slices with real Postgres, RabbitMQ, Marten, EF Core
- **When:** Testing handlers that persist data, publish messages, or call other BCs
- **Example:** `POST /api/cart/add-item` → cart persisted → event published
- **Tools:** Alba, TestContainers, xUnit, Shouldly
- **Speed:** 100-500ms per test
- **Location:** `tests/*/IntegrationTests/` (every BC has one)

**BDD Tests** — Gherkin scenarios, executable specifications
- **What:** Same as integration tests, but driven by Gherkin `.feature` files
- **When:** User-facing features with clear acceptance criteria
- **Example:** `Given a customer with items in cart, When they check out, Then order is placed`
- **Tools:** Reqnroll, Alba, TestContainers, xUnit
- **Speed:** 100-500ms per scenario
- **Location:** `tests/*/IntegrationTests/` (step definitions), `docs/features/*/` (feature files)

**E2E Tests** — Real browser, real Kestrel, full stack
- **What:** Browser automation testing the complete UI + API + SignalR flow
- **When:** Critical user journeys (checkout, order placement, vendor dashboard)
- **Example:** Open storefront → add item → checkout → verify order confirmation
- **Tools:** Playwright, Reqnroll (optional), xUnit
- **Speed:** 2-10 seconds per test
- **Location:** `tests/Storefront.E2ETests/`, `tests/VendorPortal.E2ETests/`

### Expected Test Ratios

For a mature BC like Orders:
- **~60% Integration Tests** — Most tests are Alba + TestContainers integration tests
- **~20% Unit Tests** — Pure function logic (deciders, validators, value objects)
- **~15% BDD Tests** — Key user scenarios in Gherkin format
- **~5% E2E Tests** — Critical happy paths only

### Common Testing Patterns

**Integration test with Alba + TestContainers:**
```csharp
public class OrdersTests : IClassFixture<OrdersTestFixture>
{
    private readonly OrdersTestFixture _fixture;

    public OrdersTests(OrdersTestFixture fixture) => _fixture = fixture;

    [Fact]
    public async Task PlaceOrder_WithValidData_ReturnsOrderId()
    {
        // Arrange
        var cmd = new PlaceOrder(Guid.NewGuid(), new[] { new OrderLineItem("SKU123", 2) });

        // Act
        var result = await _fixture.Host.PostJson($"/api/orders", cmd)
            .Receive<PlaceOrderResult>();

        // Assert
        result.OrderId.ShouldNotBe(Guid.Empty);
    }
}
```

**BDD test with Reqnroll:**
```gherkin
# docs/features/orders/order-placement.feature
Feature: Order Placement
  As a customer
  I want to place an order
  So that I can purchase products

  Scenario: Place order with valid items
    Given a customer with ID "cust-123"
    And items in their cart: "SKU123" (2), "SKU456" (1)
    When they place an order
    Then the order is created
    And a payment is authorized
    And inventory is reserved
```

**E2E test with Playwright:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Checkout_HappyPath_CreatesOrder()
{
    await Page.GotoAsync("http://localhost:5238");
    await Page.GetByTestId("product-sku123").ClickAsync();
    await Page.GetByTestId("add-to-cart").ClickAsync();
    await Page.GetByTestId("checkout-button").ClickAsync();
    await Page.GetByTestId("confirm-order").ClickAsync();

    await Expect(Page.GetByTestId("order-confirmation")).ToBeVisibleAsync();
}
```

## Integration Patterns

**CritterSupply uses two primary integration patterns:**

### 1. Choreography (Event-Driven, Autonomous)

**Pattern:** BCs autonomously react to events published by other BCs. No central coordinator.

**When to use:**
- Loose coupling is more important than strict ordering
- Downstream BCs can handle events asynchronously
- No need for error compensation across BCs

**Example:** Inventory reacts to `OrderPlaced`
```csharp
// In Inventory BC
public static class OrderPlacedHandler
{
    public static async Task<StockReserved> Handle(OrderPlaced evt, IInventoryRepository repo)
    {
        await repo.ReserveStock(evt.OrderId, evt.Items);
        return new StockReserved(evt.OrderId);
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ High autonomy
- ✅ Easy to add new subscribers

**Cons:**
- ❌ Hard to trace end-to-end flow
- ❌ No centralized error handling
- ❌ Eventual consistency can confuse users

**Examples in CritterSupply:**
- Inventory → Orders (stock reserved)
- Correspondence → Orders, Fulfillment, Payments (transactional emails)
- Customer Experience → Shopping, Orders, Fulfillment (real-time UI updates)

---

### 2. Orchestration (Saga-Driven, Coordinated)

**Pattern:** One BC (the orchestrator) actively coordinates others via commands/requests. Centralized state machine.

**When to use:**
- Need strict ordering of operations (payment before fulfillment)
- Need error compensation (refund if fulfillment fails)
- Business logic spans multiple BCs

**Example:** OrderSaga orchestrates Payments, Inventory, Fulfillment
```csharp
public class OrderSaga : Saga
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }

    public OutgoingMessages Handle(OrderPlaced evt, IMessageContext ctx)
    {
        Status = OrderStatus.PaymentPending;
        return new OutgoingMessages()
            .Add(new AuthorizePayment(evt.OrderId, evt.TotalAmount))
            .Add(new ReserveStock(evt.OrderId, evt.Items))
            .ScheduleTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));
    }

    public void Handle(PaymentAuthorized evt)
    {
        if (Status == OrderStatus.PaymentPending && StockReserved)
        {
            Status = OrderStatus.Confirmed;
            Publish(new RequestFulfillment(Id));
        }
    }

    public void Handle(PaymentFailed evt)
    {
        Status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
        Publish(new ReleaseStockReservation(Id));
        MarkCompleted();
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear end-to-end flow
- ✅ Centralized error handling
- ✅ Easy to add compensation logic

**Cons:**
- ❌ Orchestrator becomes a bottleneck
- ❌ Tight coupling to orchestrated BCs
- ❌ Harder to test in isolation

**Examples in CritterSupply:**
- OrderSaga (Orders → Payments, Inventory, Fulfillment)
- ReturnSaga (Returns → Fulfillment, Payments)
- BulkPricingJobSaga (Pricing → internal approval workflow)

---

### 3. Query-Only (BFF Pattern)

**Pattern:** BFF queries multiple BCs synchronously via HTTP to compose a view. No state, no persistence.

**When to use:**
- UI needs data from multiple BCs
- No domain logic, pure composition
- Read-only operations

**Example:** Storefront BFF composes CartView
```csharp
public static class GetCartViewQuery
{
    [WolverineGet("/api/cart/{cartId}")]
    public static async Task<CartView> Get(
        Guid cartId,
        IShoppingClient shopping,
        ICatalogClient catalog)
    {
        var cart = await shopping.GetCart(cartId);
        var products = await catalog.GetProducts(cart.Items.Select(i => i.Sku));

        return new CartView(
            cart.Id,
            cart.Items.Select(i => new CartItemView(
                i.Sku,
                products[i.Sku].Name,
                i.Quantity,
                products[i.Sku].Price
            ))
        );
    }
}
```

**Examples in CritterSupply:**
- Customer Experience (Storefront) queries Shopping, Orders, Catalog, Customer Identity
- Vendor Portal queries Vendor Identity, Orders, Fulfillment, Pricing

---

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Pattern | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Order placement requires payment, stock reservation, and fulfillment | **Orchestration (Saga)** | Strict ordering, compensation needed |
| Send email when order is placed | **Choreography** | Loose coupling, no compensation needed |
| Show customer their order history | **Query-Only (BFF)** | Read-only, no domain logic |
| Return approval triggers refund and replacement order | **Orchestration (Saga)** | Multi-step workflow with compensation |
| Update inventory when shipment is dispatched | **Choreography** | Autonomous reaction, eventual consistency OK |

---

## Common Mistakes & Anti-patterns

**AI agents: avoid these patterns at all costs.**

### 1. ❌ Mutable Aggregates

**Wrong:**
```csharp
public class Order
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }  // ❌ Setter allows mutation
    public List<OrderLineItem> Items { get; set; }  // ❌ Mutable list
}
```

**Right:**
```csharp
public sealed record Order(Guid Id, IReadOnlyList<OrderLineItem> Items);
```

**Why:** Immutability prevents accidental state corruption. Event-sourced aggregates must be reconstitutable from events.

---

### 2. ❌ Handlers with Side Effects

**Wrong:**
```csharp
public static class AddItemHandler
{
    public static void Handle(AddItem cmd, ShoppingCart cart, IDocumentSession session)
    {
        cart.AddItem(cmd.Sku, cmd.Quantity);
        session.Store(cart);  // ❌ Side effect in handler
    }
}
```

**Right:**
```csharp
public static class AddItemHandler
{
    public static ItemAdded Handle(AddItem cmd, ShoppingCart cart)
    {
        // Pure function - returns event, no side effects
        return new ItemAdded(cart.Id, cmd.Sku, cmd.Quantity);
    }
}
```

**Why:** Wolverine manages persistence. Handlers should be pure functions.

---

### 3. ❌ Forgetting `MarkCompleted()` in Sagas

**Wrong:**
```csharp
public void Handle(OrderCancelled evt)
{
    Status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
    // ❌ Saga never completes, stays in database forever
}
```

**Right:**
```csharp
public void Handle(OrderCancelled evt)
{
    Status = OrderStatus.Cancelled;
    MarkCompleted();  // ✅ Saga is removed from storage
}
```

**Why:** Orphaned sagas accumulate in the database and waste resources.

---

### 4. ❌ Forgetting to Add Projects to Solution Files

**Wrong:**
```bash
dotnet new classlib -n MyNewBC -o "src/MyNewBC"
# ❌ Forget to add to .sln and .slnx
```

**Right:**
```bash
dotnet new classlib -n MyNewBC -o "src/MyNewBC"
dotnet sln add "src/MyNewBC/MyNewBC.csproj"  # ✅ Add to .sln
# ✅ Manually add to .slnx as well (for IDE Solution Explorer)
```

**Why:** Project won't build in CI, won't appear in IDE Solution Explorer.

---

### 5. ❌ Using Mutable Collections

**Wrong:**
```csharp
public List<OrderLineItem> Items { get; init; }  // ❌ List<T> is mutable
```

**Right:**
```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<OrderLineItem> Items { get; init; }  // ✅ Immutable
```

**Why:** Caller could mutate the collection, breaking immutability guarantees.

---

### 6. ❌ Not Sealed by Default

**Wrong:**
```csharp
public record AddItemToCart(Guid CartId, string Sku, int Quantity);  // ❌ Not sealed
```

**Right:**
```csharp
public sealed record AddItemToCart(Guid CartId, string Sku, int Quantity);  // ✅ Sealed
```

**Why:** Commands, events, and models should be sealed by default. Inheritance is rarely needed.

---

### 7. ❌ Adding Implementation Details to CONTEXTS.md

**Wrong:**
```markdown
### Orders BC
Owns order lifecycle. Publishes `OrderPlaced`, `OrderConfirmed`, `OrderShipped`.
Handlers: `PlaceOrderHandler`, `ConfirmOrderHandler`.
```

**Right:**
```markdown
### Orders BC
Owns commercial commitment — checkout aggregate and order lifecycle saga that orchestrates Payments, Inventory, Fulfillment.
```

**Why:** CONTEXTS.md describes "what and who", not "how". Implementation details live in code.

---

### 8. ❌ Mixing Domain Logic in API Projects

**Wrong:**
```
src/Orders/
└── Orders.Api/                         # ❌ API project
    ├── PlaceOrderHandler.cs            # ❌ Domain logic in API project
    └── OrderSaga.cs                    # ❌ Domain logic in API project
```

**Right:**
```
src/Orders/
├── Orders/                             # ✅ Domain project
│   ├── Order/PlaceOrderHandler.cs
│   └── Order/OrderSaga.cs
└── Orders.Api/                         # ✅ API project (infrastructure only)
    ├── Program.cs
    └── Queries/GetOrderQuery.cs
```

**Why:** Separation of concerns. Domain logic should be in domain project, infrastructure in API project.

---

### 9. ❌ Not Reading Skill Files Before Implementing

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Add a saga for order placement"
Agent: [Writes saga without reading wolverine-sagas.md]
Agent: [Forgets MarkCompleted(), uses wrong Marten configuration, misses idempotency guards]
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Add a saga for order placement"
Agent: [Reads docs/skills/wolverine-sagas.md first]
Agent: [Implements saga correctly with all patterns from skill file]
```

**Why:** Skill files document 2+ years of lessons learned. Don't reinvent the wheel.

---

### 10. ❌ Using `List<T>.Add()` Instead of `with` Expressions

**Wrong:**
```csharp
cart.Items.Add(newItem);  // ❌ Mutates existing collection
```

**Right:**
```csharp
var updatedCart = cart with { Items = cart.Items.Append(newItem).ToList() };  // ✅ Immutable update
```

**Why:** Immutable updates preserve original state, enable time-travel debugging, and prevent race conditions.

---

## Project Creation Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** When creating new projects (APIs, test projects, Blazor apps, etc.), always follow this checklist:

### New Project Checklist

1. **Create the project:**
   ```bash
   dotnet new <template> -n <ProjectName> -o "<path>"
   ```

2. **Add to solution file(s):**
   ```bash
   # How to add the project to a .sln file (classic solution file - for dotnet CLI)
   dotnet sln add "<path>/<ProjectName>.csproj"

   # How to add to .slnx (modern XML solution file - for Visual Studio/Rider Solution Explorer)
   # Manually edit CritterSupply.slnx and add project to appropriate <Folder> section
   ```
   **Why:**
   - We want to make sure that projects, along with specific files like markdown documentation (.MD) are visible in the "Solution Explorer" view when it's enabled in Visual Studio or Rider.

3. **Add package references:**
   - Use `<PackageReference Include="PackageName" />` (no version - Central Package Management)
   - If package not in `Directory.Packages.props`, add it there first with version

4. **Configure launchSettings.json (if API/Web project):**
   - Check port allocation table (see API Project Configuration section above)
   - Use next available port
   - Update port allocation table in this file

5. **Build and verify:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

6. **Update documentation:**
   - Add run instructions to README.md
   - Update bounded context status table if applicable
   - Update port allocation table in CLAUDE.md

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting step 2 (adding to `.sln` and `.slnx`) - this breaks IDE tooling
- Adding to `.sln` but forgetting `.slnx` - project builds but doesn't appear in IDE Solution Explorer
- Creating duplicate entries in `.slnx` - keep projects organized in appropriate folder sections

---

## Cross-Context Refactoring

After changes affecting multiple bounded contexts, **always run the full test suite**:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

**When to run all tests:**
- Adding/removing project references between BCs
- Moving code between projects
- Updating namespaces across files
- Refactoring handlers or sagas
- Modifying `Messages.Contracts`

**Exit criteria:**
- ✅ Solution builds with 0 errors
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass

## When to Use Context7

These skills document CritterSupply's established patterns. For exploring Wolverine/Marten capabilities beyond these patterns, use Context7:

- `@context7 wolverine saga` — when evaluating saga patterns
- `@context7 marten projections` — for advanced projection types
- `@context7 wolverine http` — for HTTP endpoint features
